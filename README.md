# IPA Converter

A simple phonetics tool designed to help language learners understand pronunciation through the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

## Guiding Question
Given a word or sentence, how can phonetic transcription help a learner better understand its pronunciation?

## Description
This project takes written text as input and outputs its corresponding IPA transcription, making pronunciation explicit and accessible—especially for learners who struggle with irregular spelling-to-sound correspondences.  
It blends computational linguistics, phonetics, and computer science, focusing on clarity, usability, and linguistic accuracy.

## Personal Motivation
Not only am I creating this project to further my skills in Python programming and phonetics knowledge, I am also an avid language learner. From learning English up to a fluent level, I then engaged with Spanish and now Mandarin. A huge problem I encountered—and still encounter—is applying sounds from one language (like French) to another (like English), which often leads to pronunciation mistakes.  

I want to develop this software to help myself with the languages I am learning as well as others, by blending IPA transcription, phonetics, and gamification to foster a love for learning and improve pronunciation skills.

## Computational Linguistics Concepts
- **Phonetics and Phonology**: Representation of sounds using IPA symbols.  
- **Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion (G2P)**: Translating written words into phonetic pronunciation.  
- **String Processing / Tokenization**: Breaking input into words or syllables for analysis.  
- **Optional NLP components**: e.g., text normalization, handling homographs.  

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HilarieSherile/project1_phonetics.git
cd project1_phonetics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Instructions 
Run the program in your terminal. 
```bash 
python ipa_converter.py
```

1. Input a word or sentence in the terminal. 
2. The program outputs the IPA transcription. 

Example: 
Input: hello
Output: həˈloʊ

You can use this tool to practice pronunciation, create phonetic dictionaries, or integrate it into language learning applications. 

## Features
Converts words/sentences to IPA
Terminal-based tool for practice and learning

## Future Enhancements
1. Minimal pair exercises
2. Example sentences for context
3. Gamification (streaks, points)
4. Web app interface
